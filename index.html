		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="John Tracy's profile picture">

		<p>Hello, my name is John Tracy. I race motocross and I am an aspiring web developer. Oh yeah, and coffee is my favorite thing in the world. I have been on two wheels most of my life and racing motorcycles is my passion, racing gives me a feeling like no other and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Racing motocross keeps me positive, healthy, and most of all keeps me forward thinking and progressive in all other parts of my life. Nothing can be gained without the proper hard work and preparation; this is the mentality I apply to my training in the skill of web development. Aside from playing around with HTML and CSS in high school, I have been actively studying web development for about one and a half years now. I have taken several classes on front-end web development, as well as a class on C++ programming. Through these experiences I realized that I truly enjoy web development and wanted to know everything there is to know about it. Through a lot of self-teaching I have learned HTML/CSS, how to work with WordPress, I understand the fundamentals of PHP and JavaScript server-side programming languages (learning C++ as my first language helped a lot with this), and I have a basic understanding of databases. I know a bit about all these awesome things, but up until this point I have needed proper instruction on how to use all these tools the right way, in a real world situation. That is why I couldn't be happier to be a part of the UCF Coding Boot camp!
